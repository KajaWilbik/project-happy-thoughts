# Happy Thoughts

Week 7 of Technigo Bootcamp. Project Happy Thoughts communicator

The biggest problem was to understand how fetch get and fetch post work together, and how to connect everything and make it work. Coding sessions as well help from team and classmates made this journey fun and challenging.
